            <p>One of the most famous lakes in Kashmir, the Dal Lake is actually made of three lakes and doesn't

               floating islands all making it look like a group of islands in a water body. This is one of the 
               most famous attractions in Srinagar and a stay in a houseboat here, truly offers an awesome experience.</p>
